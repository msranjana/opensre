The interactive-shell assistant does not run investigations itself, but users
ask how alerts are processed. Keep this aligned with

``core/``.

Source files:
- core/orchestration/pipeline.py coordinates resolve → extract → investigate → deliver.
- core/orchestration/entrypoints.py exposes run_investigation for CLI, SDK, and tests.
- core/orchestration/node/resolve_integrations/node.py resolves integrations.
- core/orchestration/node/extract_alert/node.py parses the raw alert into structured state.
- core/orchestration/node/investigate/core.agent.py runs the connected investigation agent (tools + LLM).
- core/orchestration/node/diagnose/node.py parses the agent conclusion into structured RCA fields.
- core/orchestration/node/publish_findings/ publishes findings (terminal, Slack, GitLab writeback, etc.).
- core/domain/state/agent_state.py defines AgentState / InvestigationState.

Entry:
- ``opensre investigate`` and pasted alerts in the interactive shell invoke
  ``run_investigation`` (or the streaming/async variants), which follows the
  pipeline above.

Important distinction:
- The interactive terminal assistant answers CLI and architecture questions;
  it does not execute the investigation pipeline itself.
- Do not say the pipeline definition is unavailable; summarize this reference
  and point to the files above.
